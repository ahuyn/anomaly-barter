        <text>My back really hurts. I could use a nice warm artifact or two to soothe it. Could you bring me a few things?</text>

        <text>Ahh, that's much better. Please take this for your trouble.</text>

    <string id="st_forester_tea">
        <text>Nothing beats a cup of tea on a chilly autumn night. My friend Beard in the Skadovsk makes a special brew - I'll give you this complicated shotgun for some. I have my trusty hunting rifle and don't need anything else.</text>

    <string id="st_forester_salmon">
        <text>I do dearly miss the taste of smoked meats. I'll trade you this gun I found from a strange group of men in exchange for some salmon and sausage. I can't use this anyway, I've never seen these kinds of bullets in my life.</text>

    <string id="st_forester_pills">
        <text>It's getting harder for me to fall asleep as an old man. Can you bring me some medicine? I'll give you this strange pistol that uses very small bullets.</text>
