        <text>We've acquired a cache of some high-quality weapons from our...business partners. Obviously we were planning on reselling them to our other contacts but in the time being we're in a bit of a pinch supply-wise. Help us with our supply issue and we'll spare you some of the lower end stock.</text>

        <text>Situation here is no joke. We've been able to find a lot of good material around here, but there's a lot of tough close quarters combat. If you have anything that works well for close encounters, we'd appreciate it a lot.</text>

        <text>We ended up being able to ambush a squad of Monolith successfully. Got some good stuff.</text>
