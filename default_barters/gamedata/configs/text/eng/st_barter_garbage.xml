        <text>Stalker, have you had mutant meat? I know it's not that great, but I've got some contacts on the outside who will pay a pretty penny for some salted, seasoned mutant jerky. The more exotic, the better, eh? So if you bring me meat, I'll be sure to keep you supplied with the means to keep bringing in meat, if you know what I mean.</text>

        <text>Thanks, stalker. I've got enough of this type for now.</text>

        <text>You don't look like you're equipped to hunt. I have a spare hunting knife - prove to me you're at least capable of killing a Flesh or something and it's yours.</text>

    <string id="st_hunter_knife_done">
        <text>Not bad. Here you go.</text>

    <string id="st_hunter_toz">
        <text>Are you really trying to hunt with that thing? You're going to end up wasting ammo just to bring down a pig! A hunter can't really hunt effectively without a good rifle, so, bring me the pelt of a boar and I'll give you a good rifle.</text>

        <text>Good work. Here you go.</text>

    <string id="st_hunter_tozcer">
        <text>I have a spot missing in my trophy collection - a Chimera's hide, horns and claws. I trust if you can get it for me, I'll bequeath you my personal shotgun.</text>

        <text>Excellent work! Here you go, use her well.</text>

        <text>We don't really have much in the way of stuff to barter here, unless you want random collections of parts from the workshops. Do you have any radiation medicine, actually? The diggers aren't doing so well.</text>

    <string id="st_flea_guns">
        <text>The diggers are tired of being shit on. There's a group of bandits near one of our dig sites that keeps taking whatever we pull out of the ground. To hell with them! Bring some weapons for us to fight the bastards off, we'll give you some of our good stuff.</text>
