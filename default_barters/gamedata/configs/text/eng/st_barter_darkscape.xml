        <text>The diggers have found some good stuff here but we're running low on supplies and we can't afford to send anyone back for resupply while we're camped here. If you can bring us some stuff, we'll be sure to share some of the artifacts we've found.</text>

        <text>There's very long sightlines in this area and it's hard to spot things from so far away. Can you bring us some optical sights and binoculars? We have some artifacts we can trade for them.

    <string id="st_darkscape_suit">
        <text>Your suit is good, for a novice I suppose. However, somone of your standing and skill could use something a bit more specialized. Bring me a few things and I'll see what I can do about it.</text>

        <text>I've been in this Zone for so long, hunting and eating the creatures here, I can't eat any normal food now. I don't seem to get sick from the meat. Some folks have paid me in canned food that I can't eat, so I'll exchange some for some grilled mutant meat.</text>

        <text>Thanks, stalker, that hits the spot.</text>
