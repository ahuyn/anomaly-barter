        <text>There's a shortage of certain supplies we need. The men are more than willing to barter for them.</text>

        <text>Thanks. Keep it quiet, ok?</text>

    <string id="st_spooner_vityaz">
        <text>There's a special request from one of the senior officers. He's looking for a little nose candy, and he's putting up his submachine gun. It's one of the newer ones, and as far as I'm concerned it's never been shot.</text>

    <string id="st_spooner_trophy">
        <text>A few of the senior officers have requests for trophy weapons, specifically American ones. American weapons aren't easy to find in the Great Land beyond World War museum pieces, so they'll fetch a significant price as long as they were 'acquired' legitimately.</text>

    <string id="st_armytech">
        <text>Want some equipment? A lot of people never make it back, so I have a few scattered things sitting around. I really need more repair supplies, so I'll trade you for whatever you can find.</text>

    <string id="st_armymedic">
        <text>I can swap some medicine for you if you want. The biggest threat out here is radiation and poisoning, and our stocks of antirads are running low.</text>

    <string id="st_armymedic_patch">
        <text>The majority of our casualties, if they aren't from anomalies, are from those damn mercenaries. Attrition is high and the men are baying for blood. They've chipped into a common reward pool for whoever can thin out the Mercs.</text>
