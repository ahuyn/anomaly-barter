        <text>Some Ecologists and enterprising stalkers have supposedly developed devices that help them navigate anomaly fields more safely and effectively. I can offer some useful supplies in exchange.</text>

        <text>Have you seen those artifact detectors those stalkers are using? I need a few samples so I can try and reverse engineer or fix them. Whatever you bring, I'll reward you.</text>
