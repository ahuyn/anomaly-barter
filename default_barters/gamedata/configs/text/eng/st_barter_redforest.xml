        <text>I have some assorted artifacts if you're interested. I don't need much - the house gets awfully cold and drafty. Could you bring me a few things to help keep an old man warm?</text>

        <text>Ahh, that's much better. Thank you.</text>

    <string id="st_forester_artifact_therm">
        <text>There is one thing, actually. I would like to find some thermal artifacts to help make some hot water, but I can't find any in this area. I do have this nice Goldfish though - could you bring me something suitable in exchange?</text>
