        <text>With all the fighting that goes down by the Barrier and the shape of the recon teams that come back, we need good medical supplies. Band-aids won't cut it - we need tourniquets, trauma kits and hemostatics. All we have here is fucking cold medicine and antirad! Can we rely on you?</text>
