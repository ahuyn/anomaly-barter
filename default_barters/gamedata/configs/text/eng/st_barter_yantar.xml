        <text>Got anything to drink? If you do, well...I'll make sure there are some 'accounting errors' in the ammo inventory.</text>

        <text>We've got a surplus of these old uniforms around. Most of them won't fit any new joinees, and they'll definitely try to trade up anyway when they get the chance. I'll let one slip to you for a few bottles of Nemiroff.</text>

    <string id="st_spirit_vodka_berill">
        <text>Hey stalker, today's your lucky day. We got a new shipment of Berills and seems like there was a discrepancy. We have one left over, as you see. It can be yours..for a price.</text>

        <text>Hey stalker, I've been hearing about the good work you've done for the scientists here. Long story short - some specops guy accidentally got electrocuted, and he's left his set of armor with us. If you don't mind the smell of burnt hair, it'll serve you really well. You know the drill...bottles up front.</text>

        <text>Thanks, stalker. We'll toast to you.</text>

        <text>I spend all day here tinkering with scientist equipment, and no one thought of bringing anything good to eat. Bring me something tasty and I'll share some equipment with you.</text>

        <text>As an unofficial part of the sample collection compensation program, I have put up for exchange a limited selection of our field medical supplies. Should you find yourself in possession of rare mutant samples, we will gladly exchange some of our medical items for them.</text>

    <string id="st_sakharov_suit">
        <text>One of our field operatives was lost following a teleportation mishap. His suit is intact. I understand that these suits are quite valuable here, so I am offering a fair price for it.</text>
