        <text>We've acquired a cache of some high-quality weapons from our...business partners. Obviously we were planning on reselling them to our other contacts but in the time being we're in a bit of a pinch supply-wise. Help us with our supply issue and we'll spare you some of the lower end stock.</text>

        <text>There's no shortage of Monolith here we can scavenge for supplies here and there. Like I said, though, not all their ammo is compatible with our equipment. I can exchange some of what we found for what we actually need.</text>
