        <text>Greetings, stalker. Here at Duty we reward all who help us in our endeavor to keep the Zone free of mutant scum. Bring me proof that you've put down some monsters, and we'll restock your ammunition to show our appreciation.</text>

        <text>Hey, stalker. The diggers have found some good stuff here but we're running low on supplies and we can't afford to send anyone back for supplies this far from Cordon. If you can bring us some stuff, we'll be sure to share some of the artifacts we've found.</text>
