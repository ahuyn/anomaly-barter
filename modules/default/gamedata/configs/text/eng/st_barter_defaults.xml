        <text>Good work, stalker. Your business is appreciated.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_sid_jelly_suit">
        <text>So, today's your lucky day. I have a spare suit lying around - previous owner won't be needing it anymore. I need to make sure if it goes to you it won't find its way back to me again. Show me you're somewhat competent, eh, and I'll hand it over. Think of it as startup capital.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_sid_jelly_suit_done">
        <text>Nice work, stalker. Here you go. Be sure to remember your old pal Sid when you become rich, ok?</text>
    </string>
    
    <string id="st_sid_shotgun">
        <text>Damn bandits keep undercutting my business. I send couriers out, they get intercepted, I send out envoys, they come back with empty pockets! Stalker, are you willing to help me deal with this problem? Bring me proof of your willingness to..take care of business and I'll give you this gun. Think of it as the start of a long and fruitful relationship.</text>

    <string id="st_sid_shotgun_done">
        <text>Good work, stalker. There's no shortage of the bastards running around but this will make it a lot easier for you.</text>

    <string id="st_sid_salmon">
        <text>Barkeep has connections to a smoked salmon producer in Kyiv. There's nothing better to enjoy crackers with but salmon and a bit of cream cheese. Whatever salmon you can get for me, I will provide you something from my personal stores.</text>

    <string id="st_loris_ak">
        <text>Stalker, are you really running around with that pea shooter? At this rate you'll be dead so quickly there won't be anything valuable to strip off your corpse. I have this old AK, real Cold War relic, and customers aren't too keen on it because they prefer more modern, lighter weapons. I'll let you have it if you get me something decent to eat.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_loris_ak_done">
        <text>Thanks, stalker. I could really use something to wash this down, too, hmm..</text>

        <text>Need ammo for that AK? I happen to have a few crates lying around. Get me something to drink and we'll have a deal.</text>

    <string id="st_loris_762_done">
        <text>Thanks, stalker. I have to wait for Sid to get another shipment in, but keep the beer coming.</text>

    <string id="st_xenotech_scrap">
        <text>Hello, stalker. As you know there's no shortage of things to fix around these parts - I have all the tools I need, but finding spare parts can be hard, especially because most of it gets glossed over. If you can find any scrap or screws, I'll be willing to trade you some of my excess repair supplies.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_xenotech_scrap_done">
        <text>Thanks for the help, stalker. This will do for now.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_hunter_meat">
        <text>Stalker, have you had mutant meat? I know it's not that great, but I've got some contacts on the outside who will pay a pretty penny for some salted, seasoned mutant jerky. The more exotic, the better, eh? So if you bring me meat, I'll be sure to keep you supplied with the means to keep bringing in meat, if you know what I mean.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_hunter_meat_done">
        <text>Thanks, stalker. I've got enough of this type for now.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_flea_toolkit">
        <text>Hi pal. You want this old set of tools? Well, one of these Duty guys have been hassling us for some 'protection' money as a favor. I figure giving them a few mags and some smokes might get them to leave us alone. Better than seeing him 'accidentally' die in the next mutant raid. Scratch my back, I scratch yours.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_petrenko_trophies">
        <text>Greetings, stalker. Here at Duty we reward all who help us in our endeavor to keep the Zone free of mutant scum. Bring me proof that you've put down some monsters, and we'll restock your weapons for you.</text>

        <text>Thanks, stalker. I've got enough of this type for now.</text>

    <string id="st_darkscape_arty">
        <text>Hey, stalker. The diggers have found some good stuff here but we're running low on supplies and we can't afford to send anyone back for supplies this far from Cordon. If you can bring us some stuff, we'll be sure to share some of the artifacts we've found.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_darkscape_arty_done">
        <text>Great! Here you go.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_smokes">
        <text>Hey, pal. Got any smokes?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_smokes_done">
        <text>Thanks man.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_aspirin_stims">
        <text>Hi stalker. Some of the Duty guys are complaining that their patrols and raids are taking a toll on them physically and mentally. I only have so much of caffeine and other stimulants to distribute - </text>
    </string>
    <string id="st_aspirin_stims_done">
        <text>Nice, some good shit! Here you go, as promised.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="st_skinflint_weed">
        <text>Welcome to Army Warehouses, stalker. I'm certain you're aware that our 'reputation' precedes us. We have plenty of munitions and other supplies in our stores - a surplus, honestly. What we don't have is enough good stuff for the boys. Help us out and we'll keep you supplied. </text>

    <string id="st_skinflint_weed_done">
        <text>We appreciate your business.</text>
