        <text>We've got a surplus of these old uniforms around. Most of them won't fit any new joinees, and they'll definitely try to trade up anyway when they get the chance. I'll let one slip to you for a few bottles of Nemiroff.</text>

        <text>Hey stalker, today's your lucky day. We got a new shipment of Berills and seems like there was a discrepancy. We have one left over, as you see. It can be yours..for a price.</text>

        <text>Hey stalker, I've been hearing about the good work you've done for the eggheads here. Long story short - some specops guy got his leg blown off from a Monolith RPG not too long ago, and he's left his set of armor with us. I just had to sew on one pants leg, and it's good as new! You know the drill...bottles up front.</text>

        <text>Thanks, stalker. We'll toast to you.</text>

        <text>Greetings, stalker. Spirit makes sure we have plenty of stuff to drink, but I need something to eat with the vodka. Bring me something and I'll slip you some military ballistic inserts.</text>
