        <text>Hey, soldier. Me and the boys stuck on guard duty are bored out of our minds, though I guess it beats walking into anomalies or becoming Pseudodog food. .</text>

        <text>So listen, I know you're trustworthy, so I'll let you in on something. One of the long range patrol guys, I won't say who, is planning to defect and has everything cut out with the fat man. However, he needs one little thing - a Meat Chunk - and he's a free man. He's willing to trade in his machine gun if it means freedom. Can you help?.</text>

        <text>This fucking Zone! All of our equipment rusts before our eyes! We've burned through almost all of our cleaning supplies keeping our damn weapons operational, and every other day people show up with rips, tears, burned clothing and other crap! Look, if you can get me some extra repair material, I'll make it up to you somehow. Can you help me out?</text>

        <text>Great, this'll last us a bit longer. Thanks for the help.</text>
