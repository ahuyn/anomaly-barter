        <text>With all the fighting that goes down by the Barrier and the shape of the recon teams that come back, we need good medical supplies. Band-aids won't cut it - we need tourniquets, trauma kits and hemostatics. All we have here is fucking cold medicine! Can we rely on you?</text>

        <text>Hey bro! We got a real problem with Monolith, like most of us stalkers tend to do. Recently they're getting real bold, putting the pressure on our Barrier boys. Help me thin their numbers a bit, I'll hook you up.</text>
